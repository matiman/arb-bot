# üîÑ Task Logging & Resume Protocol

**‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH PRIORITY - MANDATORY FOR ALL TASKS**

This document defines the **critical protocol** for logging task completions and resuming work. The AI agent MUST follow these procedures after every task completion and before starting any work session.

## üéØ Overview

### Why This Protocol Exists

1. **Prevent Duplicate Work** - Always know what's been completed
2. **Enable Resume** - Pick up exactly where we left off after disconnection
3. **Create Audit Trail** - Permanent record of all implementation decisions
4. **Facilitate Handoff** - Another AI or human can continue the work
5. **Track Learning** - Document what worked and what didn't

### When to Use This Protocol

- ‚úÖ **AFTER** every task completion and human confirmation
- ‚úÖ **BEFORE** starting any work (new session or continuation)
- ‚úÖ **DURING** disconnections or interruptions

---

## üìù Logging Protocol (After Each Task)

### **‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY STEP AFTER HUMAN CONFIRMS "CONFIRMED ‚úÖ"**

When the human confirms a task is complete, the AI agent must **IMMEDIATELY** create a conversation log.

### Step-by-Step Process

```markdown
## üìù Logging Task {N} Completion

Before proceeding to Task {N+1}, I'm creating a permanent log of our conversation.

**Executing logging command...**
```

### Command Template

````bash
# Create the conversation log for this task
cat > docs/ai_prompts/task{N}_response.md << 'EOF'
# Task {N}: {TASK_NAME}

**Date Completed:** {CURRENT_DATE_TIME}
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED AND CONFIRMED BY HUMAN

## üìä Summary

### What Was Implemented
- Custom error type hierarchy using `thiserror`
- `ArbitrageError` enum with 8 variant types
- `From` trait implementations for common error conversions
- Type alias `Result<T>` for ergonomic error handling
- Comprehensive error documentation
- Unit tests for error creation and conversion
- Integration tests for error propagation

### Files Created/Modified

## üîß Implementation Details

### TDD Process Followed

1. ‚ùå **Tests Written First** - All 8 tests failed initially (expected)
2. üíª **Implementation** - Built error types to pass tests
3. ‚úÖ **Tests Pass** - All tests now green
4. üìù **Documentation** - Added comprehensive rustdoc

### Key Design Decisions

- Used `thiserror` for ergonomic derive macros
- Created rich error variants with contextual information
- Implemented `From` traits for std::io::Error and serde_json::Error
- Added optional fields for error codes and retry timing
- Display messages are user-friendly and actionable

### Rust Patterns Used

- **Error Enums**: Strongly-typed error variants
- **Type Aliases**: `Result<T>` for convenience
- **Trait Implementation**: `From` for error conversion
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive rustdoc with examples

---

## üí° Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Error Context Loss

**Problem:** Converting from std errors lost context about what operation failed
**Solution:** Created wrapper variants with `message` field to add context
**Learning:** Always add context when converting errors

### Challenge 2: Error Display Formatting

**Problem:** Default Debug formatting wasn't user-friendly
**Solution:** Implemented custom Display with actionable messages
**Learning:** Error messages should guide users toward solutions

## üîç Resume Protocol (Start of Any Session)

### **‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY STEP BEFORE STARTING ANY WORK**

At the beginning of **every work session** (new conversation or continuation), the AI agent must check what's already been completed.

### Step-by-Step Process

```markdown
## üîç Checking Previous Progress

Let me verify which tasks have already been completed to avoid duplicate work...

**Executing resume check...**
````

### Command Template

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "=========================================="
echo "  üìã TASK COMPLETION STATUS CHECK"
echo "=========================================="
echo ""

# Check if the ai_prompts directory exists
if [ ! -d "docs/ai_prompts" ]; then
    echo "‚ÑπÔ∏è  No previous task logs found."
    echo "   This appears to be a fresh start."
    echo "   Starting from Task 1..."
    exit 0
fi

# List all completed task logs
echo "üîç Scanning for completed task logs..."
echo ""

COMPLETED_TASKS=()
for i in {1..8}; do
  FILE="docs/ai_prompts/task${i}_response.md"
  if [ -f "$FILE" ]; then
    # Extract task name
    TASK_NAME=$(grep "^# Task ${i}:" "$FILE" | head -1 | sed "s/# Task ${i}: //")

    # Extract status
    STATUS=$(grep "Status:" "$FILE" | head -1 | sed 's/.*Status:\*\* //' | sed 's/\*\*//')

    # Extract completion date
    DATE=$(grep "Date Completed:" "$FILE" | head -1 | sed 's/.*Date Completed:\*\* //' | sed 's/\*\*//')

    echo "‚úÖ Task $i: $TASK_NAME"
    echo "   Status: $STATUS"
    echo "   Completed: $DATE"
    echo ""

    COMPLETED_TASKS+=($i)
  fi
done

# Determine next task
if [ ${#COMPLETED_TASKS[@]} -eq 0 ]; then
    NEXT_TASK=1
    echo "üìç NEXT TASK: Task 1 (Starting fresh)"
elif [ ${#COMPLETED_TASKS[@]} -eq 8 ]; then
    echo "üéâ ALL TASKS COMPLETE! Phase 1 is finished."
    exit 0
else
    LAST_COMPLETED=${COMPLETED_TASKS[-1]}
    NEXT_TASK=$((LAST_COMPLETED + 1))
    echo "üìç NEXT TASK: Task $NEXT_TASK"
fi

echo ""
echo "=========================================="
echo "  üìä SUMMARY"
echo "=========================================="
echo "Completed: ${#COMPLETED_TASKS[@]}/8 tasks"
echo "Next: Task $NEXT_TASK"
echo ""

# Show the next task details from the guide
echo "üìñ Reading next task from implementation guide..."
echo ""
```

### After Running Resume Check

The AI agent must:

1. **Acknowledge findings:**

   ```markdown
   **Based on the resume check:**

   - ‚úÖ Task 1: Core Error Types - COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
   - ‚úÖ Task 2: Configuration System - COMPLETED (2025-10-30)
   - ‚úÖ Task 3: Exchange Trait - COMPLETED (2025-10-31)
   - üîÑ Task 4: WebSocket Manager - NEXT TO IMPLEMENT
   ```

2. **Confirm with human:**

   ```markdown
   I can see Tasks 1-3 are complete. Should I proceed with Task 4: WebSocket Manager?

   Please confirm with "YES, START TASK 4" or provide different instructions.
   ```

3. **Only proceed after confirmation**

---

## üìÇ Directory Structure for Logs

### Initial Setup

Create the directory structure in your repository:

````bash
# Create directory for task logs
mkdir -p docs/ai_prompts

# Create README for the directory
cat > docs/ai_prompts/README.md << 'EOF'
# AI Task Response Logs

This directory contains complete conversation logs for each completed Phase 1 task.

## Purpose

1. **Audit Trail** - Track what was built, why, and how
2. **Resume Capability** - Pick up exactly where we left off if disconnected
3. **Learning Repository** - Review what worked and what didn't
4. **Documentation** - Permanent record of implementation decisions
5. **Handoff Ready** - Enable another AI or developer to continue work

## File Naming Convention

- `task1_response.md` - Task 1: Core Error Types & Result Aliases
- `task2_response.md` - Task 2: Configuration System with Parse Pattern
- `task3_response.md` - Task 3: Exchange Trait Abstraction
- `task4_response.md` - Task 4: WebSocket Price Feed Manager
- `task5_response.md` - Task 5: Shared Price State Manager
- `task6_response.md` - Task 6: Binance WebSocket Integration
- `task7_response.md` - Task 7: Coinbase WebSocket Integration
- `task8_response.md` - Task 8: Logging & Observability

## Contents of Each Log

Each `taskN_response.md` file includes:

- ‚úÖ Completion status and date
- üìä Summary of what was implemented
- üìÅ List of files created/modified
- üß™ Complete test results
- üîß Implementation details and design decisions
- üí° Challenges encountered and solutions
- ‚úÖ Human verification confirmation
- üìú Full conversation log (every message exchanged)
- ‚û°Ô∏è Context for next task

## Usage by AI Agent

### Before Starting Work
```bash
# AI runs this to check progress
./scripts/check_task_progress.sh
````

### After Task Completion

```bash
# AI creates log immediately after human confirms
cat > docs/ai_prompts/taskN_response.md << 'EOF'
[Complete conversation log]
EOF
```

## Manual Verification

Humans can verify progress anytime:

```bash
# Quick check
ls -lh docs/ai_prompts/task*_response.md

# Detailed check
./scripts/check_task_progress.sh
```

## Backup

These logs should be:

- ‚úÖ Committed to Git
- ‚úÖ Included in regular backups
- ‚úÖ Never deleted (permanent audit trail)

## üé¨ Complete Example Flow

### Scenario: Completing Task 3

**Step 1: AI completes implementation**

```markdown
STEP 3 COMPLETE ‚úÖ

### What I Did and Why:
Implemented the Exchange trait abstraction with async methods, created common types
(Price, Order, OrderResult), and built a MockExchange for testing. Used trait objects
for polymorphism and factory pattern for exchange creation.

### TDD Process:
1. ‚ùå Wrote 12 failing tests in tests/exchange_trait.rs
2. üíª Implemented Exchange trait, types, and MockExchange
3. ‚úÖ Added unit tests for Price, Order, OrderResult
4. ‚úÖ All 28 tests now passing

### Test Results:
````

running 28 tests
test exchange_trait::test_mock_exchange_connect ... ok
test exchange_trait::test_mock_exchange_subscribe ... ok
test exchange_trait::test_mock_exchange_get_price ... ok
[... more tests ...]

test result: ok. 28 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored

```

### USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Please verify:
1. [ ] Run `cargo test`
2. [ ] Run `cargo clippy`
3. [ ] Review code for correctness
4. [ ] Reply with "CONFIRMED ‚úÖ" to proceed to Task 4

---

**‚è∏Ô∏è Waiting for your confirmation before proceeding to Task 4...**
```

**Step 2: Human reviews and confirms**

```
CONFIRMED ‚úÖ

Verification Results:
- ‚úÖ cargo test: 28/28 passed
- ‚úÖ cargo clippy: 0 warnings
- ‚úÖ Code review: Looks good, nice use of trait objects
- ‚úÖ MockExchange works perfectly for testing

Ready for Task 4!
```

**Step 3: AI immediately logs conversation**

# Return exit code based on completion
if [ $COMPLETED_COUNT -eq 8 ]; then
    exit 0  # All complete
else
    exit 1  # Work remaining
fi
```

### Make Script Executable

```bash
chmod +x scripts/check_task_progress.sh
```

### Usage Examples

```bash
# Check progress anytime
./scripts/check_task_progress.sh

# Use in CI/CD
if ./scripts/check_task_progress.sh; then
    echo "Phase 1 complete, proceed to Phase 2"
else
    echo "Phase 1 in progress"
fi

# Show quick status
./scripts/check_task_progress.sh | grep "Progress:"
```

## üéØ Integration with Main Guide

### Add Reference in phase1_implementation_guide.md

In the main guide, add this section right after "AI Agent Identity & Context":

```markdown
## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Task Logging Protocol

**HIGH PRIORITY - MUST READ FIRST**

Before implementing any tasks, read the logging and resume protocol:

üìÑ **[Task Logging & Resume Protocol](task_logging_protocol.md)**

**Key Requirements:**

- ‚úÖ Check previous progress BEFORE starting any work
- ‚úÖ Log conversation AFTER every task completion
- ‚úÖ Use logs to resume from correct point

This protocol ensures:

- No duplicate work
- Ability to resume after disconnection
- Complete audit trail
- Context preservation

**Do not skip this protocol - it is mandatory for all tasks.**
```

---

## üö® What Happens If Protocol Is Skipped

### Without Logging

- ‚ùå No record of what was done
- ‚ùå Cannot resume after disconnection
- ‚ùå May redo completed work
- ‚ùå No audit trail of decisions
- ‚ùå Lost context for next tasks

### With Logging

- ‚úÖ Complete record preserved
- ‚úÖ Resume exactly where left off
- ‚úÖ No duplicate work
- ‚úÖ Full audit trail
- ‚úÖ Context maintained

---

## üéì AI Agent Training Examples

### Good: Following Protocol

```markdown
STEP 3 COMPLETE ‚úÖ

[... completion summary ...]

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
Please verify and reply with "CONFIRMED ‚úÖ"

---

[Human confirms]

---

## üìù Logging Task 3 Completion

Creating conversation log...

[Executes logging command]

‚úÖ Log created: docs/ai_prompts/task3_response.md

## üîç Checking Progress

[Executes resume command]

Progress: 3/8 complete
Next: Task 4

Ready to proceed! üöÄ
```

### Bad: Skipping Protocol

```markdown
STEP 3 COMPLETE ‚úÖ

[Human confirms]

Let's move on to Task 4...

[WRONG - No logging, no progress check]
```

## üìû Support & Questions

If you encounter issues with the logging protocol:

1. **Check directory exists:** `ls -la docs/ai_prompts/`
2. **Verify script permissions:** `ls -l scripts/check_task_progress.sh`
3. **Run progress check:** `./scripts/check_task_progress.sh`
4. **Check file contents:** `cat docs/ai_prompts/task1_response.md`

---

## üèÅ Summary

### AI Agent Must:

1. ‚úÖ **Before ANY work:** Run resume protocol to check completed tasks
2. ‚úÖ **After EVERY task:** Create conversation log immediately after human confirms
3. ‚úÖ **Never skip:** This is HIGH PRIORITY and mandatory
4. ‚úÖ **Always verify:** File was created successfully before proceeding

### Benefits:

- üéØ No duplicate work
- üîÑ Resume capability after disconnection
- üìù Complete audit trail
- ü§ù Easy handoff to other AI/humans
- üìö Learning from past challenges
